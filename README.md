# Metal Detector – Full-Custom Analog System

This project implements a full-custom analog metal detector circuit, designed and simulated in LTspice and fabricated on PCB.

## 🧩 Architecture
- **Oscillator**: Cross-coupled LC oscillator generating high-frequency signal
- **Mixer**: Differential mixer compares variable and fixed oscillator outputs
- **Amplifier**: Multi-stage common-source amplifier chain with biasing
- **Filter**: Low-pass filter to extract amplitude variation

## 🧪 Tools Used
- LTspice for circuit simulation
- Manual hand calculations for transistor biasing and gain
- Altium Designer for PCB layout

## 📊 Key Results
- Frequency tuning and stability verified through LTspice
- Oscilloscope measurements validated functionality
- Designed for real-time metal proximity detection

## 📁 File Structure
- `/ltspice/`: Schematic files and waveforms
- `/pcb-layout/`: Board layout screenshots and schematics
- `/report/`: Summary or documentation PDF (if included)
